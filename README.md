# Machine Learning Prediction Pipeline  

This repository contains my implementation of various **machine learning models** and an **end-to-end prediction pipeline**.  
The project was developed during my **AICTE Internship (Jun–Jul 2025)**, focusing on building reusable ML workflows for prediction tasks.
